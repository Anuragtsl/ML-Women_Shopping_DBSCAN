# ML-Women_Shopping_DBSCAN

I have created Machine Learning Model With DBSCAN for Women Shopping Prediction.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for Analysis, Vizualization and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

**Download the dataset from [here](https://github.com/Anuragtsl/ML-Women_Shopping_DBSCAN/blob/main/Mall_Customers.csv)!**

# About

**Problem Statement**

Can we find more deeply and sensitive insight about potential customer, when we're clustering customer segmentation with "DBSCAN" algorithm?

**About "DBSCAN"**

DBSCAN is density-based clustering algorithm that robust to outliers (noises).

# Conclusion

With tightly setting, we found that "Cluster 3 (average age: 32)" which highest average income and spending is the most potential customer group. The second candidate is "Cluster 0 (average age: 22)" which lowest average income but spending a lot. For some countries, "Cluster 3" will represent people who are being settled down (have a family) which spending most for their children. And "Cluster 0" will represent people who are starting a new work-life after graduated that spending most for their new society life.

***This analysis is only focus on women. Maybe men have a little difference insight. Please try to find it, and share with me!***
